    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the ever-evolving real estate market, accurately predicting housing prices is crucial for investors, homeowners, and policy makers alike. This project aims to leverage the power of data science to forecast housing prices based on a variety of features, including location, square footage, and additional house characteristics. Through meticulous data importing, cleaning, and manipulation, followed by exploratory data analysis (EDA), hypothesis testing, and predictive modeling, we seek to uncover the underlying patterns that drive housing prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our journey begins with gathering comprehensive housing data from various sources, followed by rigorous preprocessing to ensure data quality and usability. We then dive deep into the data, employing statistical and visual analysis techniques to explore relationships and trends. Hypothesis testing allows us to challenge assumptions and gain insights, while machine learning models enable us to predict prices with accuracy. Finally, we encapsulate our findings, model performance, and insights in a detailed report, complemented by visualizations to aid in understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook serves as a structured guide through each phase of the project, from data importation to predictive analytics and reporting. Whether you're a seasoned data scientist or a curious enthusiast, this analysis aims to provide valuable insights into the dynamics of housing prices and demonstrate the power of data-driven decision-making in the real estate domain.\n"

    "\n",
    "1. Importing Required Libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - We are importing the pandas library, which is a powerful data manipulation library in Python. It's commonly used for data cleaning, exploration, and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Data Loading:\n",
    "   - We are using the `pd.read_csv()` function to read a CSV file. The CSV file is a common data format that stores tabular data.\n",
    "   - The path to the CSV file is provided as an argument to the `pd.read_csv()` function. This path could be a local file path or a URL to a raw CSV file online.\n",
    "   - The data from the CSV file is loaded into a DataFrame, which is a two-dimensional tabular data structure in pandas. The DataFrame is stored in the variable `df`.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the data is loaded, we typically perform exploratory data analysis and data cleaning tasks to prepare the data for further analysis or modeling.\n"

    "In this cell, we are performing several data manipulation tasks on the DataFrame `df`. Here's what's happening:\n",
    "\n",
    "Installing the `scikit-learn` used for ML eventually and Labeling\n",
    "\n",
    "1. One-Hot Encoding:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The 'Furnishing' column is being encoded using one-hot encoding. This is a process of converting categorical data variables so they can be provided to machine learning algorithms to improve predictions. With one-hot, we convert each category value into a new column and assign a 1 or 0 (True/False) value to the column Also Droping the `Furnishing_Unknown` column from the table s.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Outlier Removal:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The function `IQR_outliers()` is defined to remove outliers from a specified column of the DataFrame. Outliers are extreme values that deviate from other observations on data, they may indicate a variability in a measurement, experimental errors or a novelty. In other words, an outlier is an observation that diverges from an overall pattern on a sample.\n",
    "   - The function calculates the Interquartile Range (IQR), which is a measure of statistical dispersion, and uses it to define the upper and lower bounds for outliers. Any data points that fall below the lower bound or above the upper bound are considered outliers.\n",
    "   - This function is applied to the 'Price' and 'Size' columns of the DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Feature Engineering:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - A new column 'Price per Sqft' is created by dividing the 'Price' column by the 'Size' column. This could provide a more standardized measure of price that takes into account the size of the property.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Label Encoding:\n",
    "   - The 'Property Type' column is being encoded using label encoding. This is a popular encoding technique for handling categorical variables. In this technique, each label is assigned a unique integer based on alphabetical ordering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the first few rows of the cleaned DataFrame are displayed to verify the changes.\n",
